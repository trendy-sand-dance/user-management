**remember**

 ! order of plugin registering is super important
- static then views
- dbconnector then routes

 ! must have both reply and request if using one of these, with only reply OR request, errors 

 ! ? database queries, ? these avtually matter, the amount of them needs to match the values given in the run() that comes after
