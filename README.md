## Repo information
Database holds two tables: user data and game data. 
User management container only accesses the user data table

** if you want to change the structure of the database table(s), you must delete the db file in the database container: src/database/database.db 
AND
remove the volume to then see the changes and create a new database with the updated table(s)

To continue and add to this repo, branch subjects:
- password hashing
- google authentication
- two-factor authentication

## Repo configuration
After you've created a repo based on this template you should setup the branch rules.
#### Use rebases instead of merges
1. In your repo go to `Settings -> General`, scroll down to `Pull Requests` and disable `Allow merge commits`.
2. In `Allow squash merging` set the `Default commit message` to `Pull request title`.

#### Only commit on main using PRs
1. Go to `Settings -> Rules -> Rulesets` and create a `New ruleset -> New branch ruleset` give it a name like "protect main"
2. The the `Enforcement status` to `Active`.
3. Scroll down to `Targets` `Add target -> Include default branch`.
4. Scroll further down to `Rules` and enable `Require a pull request before merging`.
5. Expand the `Additional settings` the set `Allowed merge methods` to **Squash** and **Rebase**.

#### Fix package not building
This is because after you fork github automagically disables any actions, in order to enable them just goto the `Actions` tab in the repo's homepage.
